Natural Language Processing Expert 

#Task 
Generate me a various and realistic Multichoice Question Answering Set with answers for persian language.

This set covers only SingleAnswer Reasoning pattern questions.
Reasoning QA involves questions that require structured logical inference (e.g., deduction, pattern recognition, syllogism, or analogies), using internal consistency rather than external fact retrieval.

#Requirements
1) Contains 30 questions (10 easy question and 10 medium questions and 10 hard questions).
2) The Data set must be categorized by their difficulties.
3) The Answers have to be correct to the questions.
4) One option must be correct — i.e., Single-choice-answer format.
5) Questions should cover general Knowledge.
6) Avoid repeating patterns or obvious categories and make the dataset unpredictable and organically mixed.
7) The answer choices should only contain the final Answer.
8) The correct answer must be randomly placed among the four options (Option1 to Option4), not fixed in a single position. The correct answers should be evenly distributed across different option slots to ensure realism and avoid bias.
9) Ensure logical consistency: the answer must correctly follow from the question.
10) Be Aware of the complexity of the persian Language for the syntax.

# CSV File Creation Requirements
The CSV File Needs 8 Columns (Difficulties , Question, Options(option1 to option 4) each option has it owns column , Correct Option, Justification(in Persian)))).
