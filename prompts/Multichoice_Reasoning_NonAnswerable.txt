#Task 
Generate me a various and realistic Multichoice Question Answering Set with answers for persian language.

This set covers only Non-Answerable Reasoning pattern questions.
Reasoning QA involves questions that require structured logical inference (e.g., deduction, pattern recognition, syllogism, or analogies), using internal consistency rather than external fact retrieval.

#Requirements
1) Contains 30 questions (10 easy question and 10 medium questions and 10 hard questions).
2) The Data set must be categorized by their difficulties.
3) No option must be correct, but relevant to topic — i.e., Non-Answerable format.
4) Questions should cover general knowledge.
5) Avoid repeating patterns or obvious categories and make the dataset unpredictable and organically mixed.
6) Avoid template-based generation and ensure each question has a unique logical structure.
7) Ensure logical consistency: the answer must correctly follow from the question.
8) Do not return a DataFrame or table format.
9) Be Aware of the complexity of the persian Language for the syntax.

# CSV File Creation Requirements
