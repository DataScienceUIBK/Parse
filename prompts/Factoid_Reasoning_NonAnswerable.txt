#Task 
Generate me a various and realistic Factoid Question Answering Set with answers for persian language.

This set covers only Non-Answerable Reasoning pattern questions.
Reasoning QA involves questions that require structured logical inference (e.g., deduction, pattern recognition, syllogism, or analogies), using internal consistency rather than external fact retrieval.

#Requirements
1) Contains 30 questions (10 easy question and 10 medium questions and 10 hard questions).
2) The Data set must be categorized by their difficulties.
4) Questions should cover general knowledge.
5) Avoid repeating patterns or obvious categories and make the dataset unpredictable and organically mixed.
6) No Correct answer must be available — i.e., Non-Answerable format.
7) Questions where the answer could be 'no' not acceptable — create questions where no answer exists at all.
8) Ensure logical consistency: the answer must correctly follow from the question.
9) Be Aware of the complexity of the persian Language for the syntax.

# CSV File Creation Requirements
The CSV File Needs 3 Columns (Difficulties(in English) , Questions (In Persian), Answer (In Persian), Justification (Persian)).

If i ask you for more questions, you still stick to this formats and requirements and definitions and create me more and unique with top Quality.
