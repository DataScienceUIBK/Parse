Generate me a various and realistic Factoid Question Answering Set with answers for persian language.

Reasoning QA involves questions that require structured logical inference (e.g., deduction, pattern recognition, syllogism, or analogies), using internal consistency rather than external fact retrieval.

2) The Data set must be categorized by their difficulties.
3) Questions should cover general knowledge.
4) Avoid repeating patterns or obvious categories and make the dataset unpredictable and organically mixed.
5) The question must clearly request multiple factual items of the same type.
6) The expected number of items in the list as answer could be 2-4. 
7) Ensure logical consistency: the answer must correctly follow from the question.
